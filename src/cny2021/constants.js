While the engine is technically able to support any given framerate (determined
by the hardware), a baseline is required to ground our video game logic to.
e.g. we can say that we expect an object with "movement speed" of "2" to travel
120 pixels in 1 second. (2 pixels per frame * 60 frames per second)
